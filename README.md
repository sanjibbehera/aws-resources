Usage
===================
    Use the below commands to setup the resources in this repo.
    terraform init
    terraform validate
    terraform plan -out=tf.plan
    terraform apply -auto-approve tf.plan [You can setup terraform.tfvars in the root dir according to your needs].
    *** Snapshot of the 'terraform.tfvars' file has been attached in the Snapshot Folder for reference for this project.
    <Don't forget to destroy your resources using the below command to avoid incurring bills from AWS.>
    terraform destroy -auto-approve
    ** Please Note that you would require AWS Access KEYS & AWS SECRET ACCESS KEYS to 
    ** access AWS resources & also create AWS resources. 
    ** Hence create a AWS admin user using AWS IAM, it is reqd for the above tasks and configure these keys  
    ** or pass them as environment variables with the command <terraform apply> if you do not wish to store them.
